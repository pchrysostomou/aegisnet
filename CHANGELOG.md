## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repository scaffolding: ignore rules that treat secrets, packet captures, and live sensor
  output as never-committable; Docker ignore rules; MIT licence; this changelog.
- `.env.example` environment template using `__REPLACE_ME__` placeholders, and
  `infra/scripts/bootstrap_env.py` (`make bootstrap`) which generates a local
  development-only `.env` with cryptographically random secrets, idempotently and without
  printing any value (ADR-011).
- Pre-commit configuration: whitespace and merge-conflict hooks, Ruff, gitleaks, and a hook
  that hard-fails if `.env` is ever staged.
- Milestone 0 planning package: PRD, architecture, threat model, repository structure, data
  model, Milestone 1 API contract, six-milestone delivery plan, evaluation plan, and status
  record.
- ADR-009 (defer the isolated Suricata lab to Milestone 2), ADR-010 (defer the scheduler and
  periodiq to Milestone 2), ADR-011 (bootstrap-generated development secrets).
- Docker Compose topology for five services (`db`, `redis`, `api`, `worker`, `web`): every
  published port bound to `127.0.0.1`, no host port at all on `db`, `redis` or `worker`,
  `cap_drop: ["ALL"]` and `no-new-privileges:true` everywhere, dependency ordering via
  healthchecks. The worker probe is process liveness only and makes no readiness claim.
- Multi-stage backend and frontend images, both ending on a non-root `USER`, with matching
  `.dockerignore` files; a hermetic test/lint runner in `docker-compose.test.yml`; an example
  local override file, with `docker-compose.override.yml` itself gitignored.
- PostgreSQL initialisation creating two least-privilege roles, `aegisnet_migrator` and
  `aegisnet_app`. It validates every interpolated role name and secret against a strict
  allowlist and fails closed, and it creates no tables.
- `make compose-config`, `compose-ps`, `compose-logs`, `compose-down`, `pin-digests`, and a
  `require-env` guard. `up` and `build` are intentionally absent until the services they
  start have source and lockfiles.
- hadolint configuration waiving only DL3006 and DL3008, each with a recorded reason.

### Fixed
- `.env.example` no longer places comments on the same line as an assignment. Docker Compose
  `env_file` does not strip a trailing `# comment`, so `SECRET_KEY` would have been delivered
  to the container with the comment text appended to its value.
